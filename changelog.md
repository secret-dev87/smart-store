# Release Notes

## Smartstore 5.0.0

Smartstore 5 is a port of Smartstore 4 - which is based on the classic .NET Framework 4.7.2 - to the new ASP.NET Core 6 platform.

### Highlights

- Smartstore 5 is now **cross-platform** and supports **Linux** and **macOS** alongside **Microsoft Windows**. This means that Smartstore can be run on almost any hosting server, whether dedicated, cloud or shared.
- In addition to **Microsoft SQL Server**, Smartstore now supports **MySQL**. **PostgreSQL** is in planning and will follow soon.
- Smartstore 5 is one of the **fastest out-of-the-box e-commerce solutions in the world**! A small store with less than 1,000 items and a few dozen categories can achieve an average *Time to First Byte* (TTFB) of far below 100 milliseconds... even without output cache or other performance measures.
  - Compared to Smartstore 4, 10x faster in some areas
  - Significantly less memory consumption (approx. 50%)
  - Even low-cost (cloud) hosting delivers high performance
- Powerful **DataGrid** in the backend
  - Developed in-house, no more 3rd party libaries with annoying license restrictions
  - Intuitive, feature-rich and flexible
  - Supports row selection, multi-column sorting, column reordering, column toggling, paging etc.
  - Grid state is persisted in browser's local storage and restored on page refresh
  - Search filter expressions: run complex search queries, e.g. `(*jacket or *shirt) and !leather*`
  - (DEV) `datagrid` TagHelper which lets you control every aspect of the grid
- Frontend & backend **facelifting**
- Create, manage and restore **database backups** in the backend
- More **external authentication** providers: Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn coming soon
- Advanced settings for **image processing**: compression, quality, response caching etc.
